# Assistive Technology Mounting

Assistive Technology devices are often mounted on a secondary device, a wheelchair for example, so the device is available wherever it's needed. These competentices are some initial thoughts on what should covered, and some activites that could be used to develop the skills to become competent.

System do not create a risk of injury through a finger trap - allow 2cm gap
Does not impede on transfer
Levers or bolts - making it easier or harder to adjust
Sourcing components
Wheelchair manufacturers spare parts guides
Always fit mount so it moves with the client on a base with seat height adjustment or tilt. 
Might consider fitting to base frame to improve stability, and so it can't be put into an unstable position.

Consider process

Manual Wheelchair Mounts
Ensure functionality of original chair remains, for example
  * Footrest adjust and are removable
  * Brakes function
  * Safety equip,ent is not obscured, Eg. reflectors
  * Seating system can be removed
  * Foorests adjust and remove
Tilting Wheelchair Mounts
  * Tubes forward from vertical in all positions if possible so if it comes lose does not fall on client
  * Able to achieve all angles of tilt ('Forseeable misuse')
  * Stable in all positions of tilt
School Bases
  * Stability at all height positions
  * Stability during tilt
Walking Frame
  * In partciular requires treating physiotherapist
  * Ensure no negative impact on gait
  * Ensure no negative impact on posture
  * Device or mount does not impede client function, eg. transfers in and out of walker
  * Does not impede rest position
  * Stability, in particular obstacles suddenly stopping front wheels - threshold, stone under wheel
  * Decide on any limitations of use with device in place
  * Risk of injury to others
  
* Device Receivers
  * Difference in ease of use between different types
  * Compativility between different type of mount, eg floor stand and wheelchair stand
  * Flip over adapters
  *
* Type of mount
  Fixed - less weight, less to go wrong, cheaper
  Foldable easier to fold and transfer between sites
  Foldable heavier
  Allowing user adjustment vs. consistent position
  Rigidity in use - driving over cobbles/street
  Manufacturer's weight limit
  
Fitting
  * Should be able to return the product to its original state
  * Should never require modification to the host
  * Tight - torque settings? Loctite - advantages of different types.
  * Metric vs imperial fixings
  
* Wheelchair Specific Issues
  * Modulite seat frame - ensure t-nuts fully engaged. T-Nuts are available separately. Consider Loctite
  * Rectangular tube - ensure Daessy brackets correctly located around tube (see bad example)
  * Round tube options - Daessy.
  * Jenx - pain
  * JCM - quite a lot of flexibility - consider alternatives. Sometimes tricky to get bolt through boths parts as plastic over laps - put through 8mm drill to line up edges.
  * R82 - SMile Rehab bracket is shorter and less likely to stick out as much
  
Compatibility
  * Use Rehadapt receivers on Daessy mounts
  * Use articulating Daessy receiver on Rehadapt tube (not sure why)
  * Do not use standard Daessy receiver on Rehadapt tube
  
* Mounting Plate Adapters
  * PRC5 (fit device with Rehadapt plate onto Daessy mount
  * Others
  
  Receivers 
    * Eye gaze require more adjustment use articulating receiver
    * Consider fully adjustable to level up the device on fixed frame chairs if required (to take account ot twist in mount or frame)
  
  Other methods
  * Trabasacks
  * Wheelchair Tray
  * Custom tray
  * Suction mounts on tray
  * Strap to prevent accidental movement
  
  Seat riser
  * Ensure no contact with mechanism
  
  Height Adjustable School Chair

  Reversing the Offset Link
  90 degree component


* Mounting access devices
  * Head switch
  * Foot switch
  * other switch
* Mounting small devices less than 1.5kg (eg. tablet devices)
* Mounting large devices more than 1.5kg
* Mounting devices distant from the user (eye gaze)
* Mounting Powerchair
* Mounting Manual chair
* Mounting to tilting wheelbase
* Mounting to school bases
* Identifying and managing risk
  * Organisations' risk assessment and management policy
* Tilting bases
* identifying current manufacturers, suppliers and products - list them - find url
* Horizon scan for new products
* Develop own products
* Complete MAT-doc 
* Walking frame
  * Risk assessment
	* Multi Disciplinary assessment to include Physiotherapist, Occupational Therapist and Technician or Engineer. Join decision making
	* Issues to review
    * Able to safety transfer
* Complete an assessment for a mount (one only) - wheelchair, floor, other
* Desk stand
* Specialist Mounts (bespoke, wall mount)
* Complex systems
* Complete the MAT-doc
